#### **HOW IT WORKS?**
---

This assistant is made through Python. The module *pyttsx3* is used to convert text into speech for communication between user & assistant.
It has the following characteristics:
    - greets the user according to time period
    - helps you to know the current date & time
    - google a search for you
    - plays a song from the device provided the path of songs is mentioned
    - can be used as a reminder
    - memorizes the information which the user asks it to remember by writing it to a text file (here, *data.txt*)
    - tell you jokes in a boredom
    - send the mails on user's behalf
    - take a snapshot of the screen
    - update you with the device's battery
    - surf wikipedia on your behalf
    - log-out, restart and shut down the system 

You need to import the respective modules for the specific function while few modules are built-in already. 
For example, module *os* is a built-in module while *pyjokes* needs to be installed via a pip command.
All the importing information is specified in the file itself along with the pip commands.
